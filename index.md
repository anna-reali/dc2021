The Twenty-Sixth AAAI/SIGAI Doctoral Consortium (DC) will be held virtually and provide a group of PhD students with the opportunity to present, discuss, and explore their research interests and career objectives with established researchers in AI. Its objectives are to:
- Provide a setting for students to receive feedback on their current research and guidance on future research directions
- Develop a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research
- Support a new generation of researchers by offering advice about academic, research, industrial, and nontraditional career paths
- Contribute to the overall conference goals through interaction with other researchers and participation in conference events

For additional information (e.g., application procedures) please refer to the call for applications on the [AAAI-21 website](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-21/aaai21dccall/).
